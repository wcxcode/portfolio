                    “You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. <br />
                    We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconciously give other people permission to do the same. <br />
                    As we liberated from our own fear, out presence automatically liberates others.” <br /> <br />
